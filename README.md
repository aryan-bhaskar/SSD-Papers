[Various papers I've read and would like to keep here for ready future reference]

*Divided into following sub-topics*
  1. Ballistic Transport
  2. Growth
  3. RF Devices

It's always a good idea to keep organized and maintain a digital library. The fact that I can access these papers later on is super convenient.
